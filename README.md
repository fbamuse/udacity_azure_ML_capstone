# Heart Failure Prediction by Azure ML studio
## overview of the project  
Explore the best model for binary classification with Azure ML Studio.
For model optimization, we will try two cases: a case where a deep learning model is optimized by hyperdrive, and a case where model selection and tuning are automated by AutoML. The evaluation metric is AUC. The best model will be deployed for use in web services.

### Summary

- AUtoML achieved better accuracy than tuning the hyperparameters of a single model.  
    | Algorithm      | AUC      |
    |---------------|-----------|
    | AutoML(VotingEnsemble) |0.96156 |   
    | HyperDrive(3layer DNN ) |0.82479  |
    <br>
    AutoML is able to select a more superior model by trying multiple classifiers and narrowing down the most suitable model for the data while tuning the parameters.  
- Azure ML Studio enables seamless operation of workflow from model training to deployment. AutoML plays a central role in that.


- Further improvement of the model  
The number of data selected this time is just under 300, which is not enough to guarantee the generalization of the model. It is possible to build a robust model by collecting more data.
On top of that, it is also effective to eliminate the highly correlated fu tea and reduce the variables.


## Dataset

### Overview
- An overview of the dataset used  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) kills an estimated 17.9 million people each year. It accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.　Heart failure is often caused by CVD, and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict heart failure mortality.

### Task
Based on this patient information, the patient's death (Deth_Event) is estimated. The explanatory variables use the remaining 12 futures.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

select 3-layer DNN
- Five parameters of the number of hidden layers (n_hidden_1,2,3) of each layer, learning rate (learning_rate), and batch size (batch_size) were optimized by high bar drive.
- Bathch normalization is placed on each layer to promote convergence and improve accuracy.
- Relu for activation function
- Prevent overfitting with Dropout

An overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search  


- The parameter search applies random sampling, which is excellent for searching a good space with a few trials.

- Bandit Policy (evaluation_interval = 2, slack_factor = 0.1) is applied to the early termination policy. All runs with the best metric less than (1 / (1 + 0.1) or less than 91% of the best performing runs are finished
